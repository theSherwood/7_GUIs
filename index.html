      <h2>Various 7 GUIs</h2>

      <p>
        When experimenting with a new language or frontend framework, what do
        you do to get to grips with it quickly?
      </p>

      <p>
        As I enjoy GUI and frontend programming, among the first things I do is
        implement
        <a href="https://github.com/eugenkiss">Eugen Kiss</a>'s
        <a href="https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/">7GUIs Benchmark</a>. Here I
        will host the demos to my implementations of the 7GUIs and perhaps other
        tasks as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        My implementations will not be perfectly consistent across the
        frameworks. That is not the point. But if you happen to be looking over
        any of the
        <a href="https://github.com/theSherwood/7_GUIs">source code</a> for
        these implementations and find something that could be more idiomatic in
        that language or framework, don't hesitate to raise an issue!
