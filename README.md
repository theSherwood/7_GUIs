7 GUIs

When experimenting with a new language or frontend framework, what do you do to get to grips with it quickly?

As I enjoy GUI and frontend programming, among the first things I do is implement [Eugen Kiss](https://github.com/eugenkiss)'s [7GUIs Benchmark](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/). Here I will host the demos to my implementations of the 7GUIs and perhaps other tasks as well.

My implementations will not be perfectly consistent across the frameworks. That is not the point. But if you happen to be looking over any of the [source code](https://github.com/theSherwood/7_GUIs) for these implementations and find something that could be more idiomatic in that language or framework, don't hesitate to raise an issue!
